# FrequencyLowCut Pooling 
Code for [FrequencyLowCut Pooling - Plug & Play against Catastrophic Overfitting](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19781-9_3) and [Fix your downsampling ASAP! Be natively more robust via Aliasing and Spectral Artifact free Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09804)

We provide our FrequencyLowCut (FLC) module and our Aliasing and Sinc Artifact free Pooling (ASAP) as well as examples how to implement them into common CNN structures.

The code for adversarial training used in our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/locuslab/fast_adversarial).

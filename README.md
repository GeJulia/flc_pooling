# FrequencyLowCut Pooling 
Code for FrequencyLowCut Pooling - Plug & Play against Catastrophic Overfitting

We provide the FrequencyLowCut (FLC) module as well as examples how to implement it into common CNN structures.
The code for adversarial training used in our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/locuslab/fast_adversarial).

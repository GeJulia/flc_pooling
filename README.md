# FrequencyLowCut Pooling 
Code for [FrequencyLowCut Pooling - Plug & Play against Catastrophic Overfitting](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19781-9_3) and [Fix your downsampling ASAP! Be natively more robust via Aliasing and Spectral Artifact free Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09804)

We provide the FrequencyLowCut (FLC) module as well as examples how to implement it into common CNN structures.
The code for adversarial training used in our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/locuslab/fast_adversarial).

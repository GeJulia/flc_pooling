# FrequencyLowCut Pooling 
Code for [FrequencyLowCut Pooling - Plug & Play against Catastrophic Overfitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00491)

We provide the FrequencyLowCut (FLC) module as well as examples how to implement it into common CNN structures.
The code for adversarial training used in our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/locuslab/fast_adversarial).
